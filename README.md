A work-in-progress roguelike game built with C++20.

#How to build

./ietto
```

#Goals
The primary goal of this project is for me to improve my C++ skills,
particularly by using modern C++. In addition to that, learning more
about rendering, managing a bigger project and perseverance.

#Bugs
- The player movement system is disconnected from the rendered frame
